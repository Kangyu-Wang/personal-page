I’m a philosopher working mainly on moral and political philosophy, broadly defined, decision theory and practical reason, and philosophy of economics and finance. I also work on the meaning in life and philosophy of AI.

My PhD thesis, tentatively titled **Life Choices**, answers the following questions: 
- Why are some hard choices harder than other hard choices and how to genuinely resolve a hard choice?
- What is rational for one to do when one foresees that one’s preferences will change profoundly in the future, especially due to transformative experiences?
- What makes some activities in our lives meaningful while others are not meaningful and to what extent does a meaningful life need to be project-driven?
- And how should we think about our temporarily extended agencies to make sense of the importance of long-term commitments and projects given that people can and sometimes should change?

For a glimpse of my view on hard choices, you can read this [book review](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/value-incommensurability-ethics-risk-and-decisionmaking-henrik-andersson-and-anders-herlitz-ed-routledge-2022-viii269-pages/BFD9EB3700CB8E7E70AF95349B0CB656) I coauthored with Campbell Brown. 

Some of my more applied projects flow out from my interest in decision-making under risk and uncertainty and my interest in moral and political philosophy. For instance, I am developing a series of works in the **philosophy of finance**. These include:
- Research on the normative consequences of the differences among various social groups in terms of the uncertainty about their risks in the context of insurance and banking.
- Research on the relationship between the risks taken by banks and their power to create money.
- Research on central banking, especially the way central banks inject liquidity and its normative impacts.
- Research on the social costs of financialization and the power of financiers to manipulate the risk attitudes of other people.

My friend [Paul Forrester (Yale)](https://philosophy.yale.edu/people/paul-forrester) and I are collaborating on some issues in philosophy of finance. For example, we’ve been thinking about the connection between the divergence in investment returns in the long run between the rich and the poor and the difference in their risk appetites which is largely a matter of brute luck. We are also thinking about the intergenerational distributive inequality of financial assets.

I've also been increasingly interested in **Machine Learning** or **AI**. For instance, I argue that the widening use of AI in finance can bring severe challenges to the current prudential regulation system. You can read my [LSE Philosophy blog article](https://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2024/08/05/how-ai-challenges-prudential-regulation/).

I also argue that in AI regulation and long-future-oriented policies alike, due to uncertainty and unawareness, surprisingly, it could sometimes be rational to focus more on short-term consequences and be more risk-taking. The slogan is “in the long run we are all dumb”. 

I have two papers arguing that we should reject relational egalitarianism.
