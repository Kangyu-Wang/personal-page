I’m a philosopher working mainly on moral and political philosophy, broadly defined, decision theory and practical reason, and philosophy of economics. I also work on the meaning in life, philosophy of AI, and philosophy of finance.

My PhD thesis, tentatively titled **Life Choices**, answers the following questions: 
- Why are some hard choices harder than other hard choices and how to genuinely resolve a hard choice?
- What is rational for one to do when one foresees that one’s preferences will change profoundly in the future, especially due to transformative experiences?
- What makes some activities in our lives meaningful while others are not meaningful and to what extent does a meaningful life need to be project-driven?
- And how should we think about our temporarily extended agencies to make sense of the importance of long-term commitments and projects given that people can and sometimes should change?

For a glimpse of my view on hard choices, you can read this [book review](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/abs/value-incommensurability-ethics-risk-and-decisionmaking-henrik-andersson-and-anders-herlitz-ed-routledge-2022-viii269-pages/BFD9EB3700CB8E7E70AF95349B0CB656#) I coauthored with Campbell Brown. 

Some of my more applied side-projects flow out from my interest in decision-making under risk, uncertainty, and unawareness. For instance, I argue that the widening use of AI in finance can bring severe challenges to the current prudential regulation system.

I also argue that in AI regulation and long-future-oriented policies alike, due to uncertainty and unawareness, surprisingly, it could sometimes be rational to focus more on short-term consequences and be more risk-taking. The slogan is “in the long run we are all dumb”. 

I also have two papers arguing that we should reject relational egalitarianism.

My friend [Paul Forrester (Yale)](https://philosophy.yale.edu/people/paul-forrester) and I are working on some issues in finance. For example, we’ve been thinking about the connection between the divergence in investment returns in the long run between the rich and the poor and the difference in their risk appetites which is largely a matter of brute luck. We are also thinking about the intergenrational distributive inequality of financial assets.
